### Hi there 👋

🇦🇹 My name is **Christian Haudum** and I am software programmer located in [Dornbirn](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/75110), Austria.

⚗️ I have 10+ years of work experience, a profound knowledge of how to design and build scalable, distributed applications as well as hands-on know-how in leading tech teams.

🏔️ I am also passionate about playing turntables, space, and mountaineering.

🏗️ I previously worked on CrateDB Cloud at [Crate.io](https://crate.io) and now work on [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) at [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com).
